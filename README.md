# APIs
## Firebase Auth
Slackr is using Firebase Auth for our OAuth implementation. There is no native login/signup method in our application.
## Slack API
Slackr is using the Slack API for OAuth to connect the team to the workspace so that our application can send the reports as a DM. To send the DM we are using webhooks made available from the Slack Interactive Components website.

# Environment Variables
In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_API_KEY - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_BASE_URL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_SLACK_URL - this is the url/api/slack endpoint
   
# Installation Instructions
Install all dependencies by running `yarn install`

## Other Scripts
